<h1>Blog Post Website</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Welcome to my project! This is a simple blog post website made with Python and the Flask framework. I created this project to learn Flask. It allows users to register, log in, and log out using Flask-Login. For managing and creating the database, I used Flask-SQLAlchemy. Users can send emails using smtplib. To store users' passwords securely in the database, I used Werkzeug for password hashing and salting.</p>
